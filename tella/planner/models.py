"""Pydantic data models for Tella's planner output.

A Tella plan = title + global metadata + scenes. Each scene contains both
an AI image prompt AND a stock keyword (planner emits both; composer picks
which to feed downstream based on ``media_source``). This mirrors VCM's
``mix`` mode and lets us swap media sources without re-running the planner.

Multi-asset extension over VCM: ``Scene.asset_count`` (1-3) signals to the
media layer how many visuals to fetch per scene — composer then interleaves
them with Ken Burns / crossfade transitions inside the scene's duration.

Character + setting briefs are top-level (not per-scene) because they're
*locked* for the whole video — same protagonist, same setting. The planner
emits them once; ``tella.planner.character_lock`` prepends them to each
scene's ``image_prompt`` for AI image mode. Stock photo/video modes ignore
the briefs (random stock content can't honour character locking).
