"""Gemini system prompts for Tella's story planner.

Two axes of variation:

  - ``theme``         : parable | cinematic | playful | mindfulness
                        (defines storytelling tone + image style suffix)
  - ``duration_mode`` : short (5-8 scenes, 60-120s) | detailed (12-20 scenes, 4-6min)

Plus a third "always do" instruction block embedded into every prompt:

  - For ai_image media mode: produce a TOP-LEVEL ``character_brief`` +
    ``setting_brief`` JSON so every scene image_prompt can prepend them.
  - For stock_photo / stock_video modes: emit ``character_brief: null``
    + ``setting_brief: null`` (stock content is random — can't honour
    character locking) and instead produce per-scene ``stock_query``
    keywords (2-4 English words).

  - Always emit ``image_prompt`` (15-30 word English FLUX prompt) so
    composer can swap between ai_image and stock_video without re-planning.
  - Always emit ``stock_query`` (2-4 English keywords) for the same reason.

Output JSON shape matches :class:`tella.planner.models.TellaScenePlan`.

"""


# ─── Character + setting block (AI image mode only) ─────────────────────

_CHARACTER_LOCK_BLOCK = """\
CHARACTER + SETTING LOCK (because media_source == ai_image):

⚠️  AI image generators have NO MEMORY across scenes. If you write
    different image_prompts for the same character, the model renders a
    different look each time — viewer confusion. To prevent that you MUST
    emit a TOP-LEVEL ``characters`` cast + ``setting_brief``, and on EACH
    scene list which cast members appear (``character_names``). The planner
    prepends the matching identities to that scene's image_prompt.

characters shape (1-4 recurring subjects — include EVERY character the story
keeps coming back to, not just one):
  [
    {
      "name":     "<short label you will reuse in scenes, e.g. 'the hare', "
                  "'the tortoise', 'Lan'>",
      "identity": "<10-20 word description. For a PERSON: age, gender, hair, "
                  "outfit, features. For an ANIMAL/CREATURE/OBJECT: describe "
                  "THAT animal/thing precisely (species, colour, markings, "
                  "any clothing/props) — do NOT turn it into a human.>",
      "role":     "protagonist | antagonist | mentor | supporting"
    }
  ]

  IMPORTANT: if the story is about animals (a fable, a children's tale),
  the characters ARE the animals. "the tortoise" identity = a real tortoise,
  "the hare" identity = a real hare — never a human athlete or person.

  Example casts:
    - Fable: [
        {"name":"the tortoise","identity":"a small green tortoise, domed
          brown shell, wrinkled friendly face, slow steady eyes","role":"protagonist"},
        {"name":"the hare","identity":"a sleek brown hare, long ears, lean
          legs, cocky smirk, bright alert eyes","role":"antagonist"}
      ]
    - Single human: [
        {"name":"Mai","identity":"70 yo Vietnamese woman, kind round face,
          silver hair in a bun, simple brown ao dai","role":"protagonist"}
      ]

setting_brief shape:
  {
    "location":    "<short location description, 4-15 words>",
    "era":         "<period, e.g. '1960s' or '19th century' or 'timeless'>",
    "mood":        "<single word: meditative | tense | warm | cold | hopeful | …>",
    "time_of_day": "<e.g. 'golden hour' | 'blue hour' | 'midnight' | 'noon'>"
  }

PER-SCENE: set ``character_names`` to the subset of cast names that appear in
that scene (e.g. ["the hare"], or ["the hare","the tortoise"] for both, or
[] for a pure scenery/establishing shot). Each scene image_prompt describes
ONLY the ACTION / CAMERA — the planner prepends the named characters'
identities + the setting automatically. So:
  ✗ "A cocky hare napping under a tree, cinematic"   (don't restate identity)
  ✓ "napping under a broad oak, low-angle, dappled light"  + character_names ["the hare"]
"""


_STOCK_MODE_BLOCK = """\
STOCK MODE (because media_source != ai_image):

Set ``characters: []``, ``character_brief: null`` and ``setting_brief: null``
— stock content is random, character/setting locking is impossible.

Instead, emit per-scene ``stock_query`` keywords (2-4 ENGLISH words) that
Pexels can search productively:
  ✓ "earth from space", "vietnamese rice field", "office worker laptop"
  ✗ "cartoon", "8 year old girl smiling near pond at golden hour"

Also emit a complete ``image_prompt`` per scene so the user can swap to
AI image mode without re-planning — keep it as a 15-30 word English
prompt that DOES bake the character/setting context directly into the
prompt text (since there's no brief to prepend in the planner).

  - image_prompt   : ENGLISH FLUX prompt, 15-30 words. SFW; use "young
                     woman/man" not "girl/boy" when adult; add "fully
                     clothed, modest, family friendly" if any character.
  - stock_query    : 2-4 ENGLISH keywords for Pexels search
  - character_names: list of cast names appearing in this scene (ai_image
                     mode). [] for a scenery shot. Omit / [] in stock modes.
  - asset_count    : 1, 2, or 3 — how many visuals the composer should
                     show during this scene. Use 1 for static reflective
                     scenes; use 2-3 for action / montage / contrast.

GLOBAL RULES:

  * voice_script + title use TARGET_LANG. image_prompt + stock_query are

  * EACH scene introduces a DIFFERENT beat — no repetition between scenes.
  * If TARGET_LANG = "vi", title MUST have full Vietnamese diacritics
    (sắc, huyền, hỏi, ngã, nặng, mũ) — diacritic-less Vietnamese is
    unintelligible when spoken aloud. Restore tones even if user input
    was diacritic-less.
  * voice_gender already set at top-level input — echo it back unchanged.
  * voice_pace_name / voice_edge_rate / voice_google_rate / voice_name
    already set at top-level input — echo back unchanged.
  * total_duration: leave as 0.0 — composer fills after TTS.

_USER_SCRIPT_PARSE_RULES = """\
INPUT MODE: PARSE_USER_SCRIPT (CEO 2026-06-17).

The user has provided a COMPLETE narration script. Your job is NOT to write
a new story — your job is to PARSE the user's script into scenes and add
visuals + timing so the renderer can produce the video.

HARD RULES (NEVER violate):

  1. PRESERVE the user's text VERBATIM in voice_script. Do NOT paraphrase,
     summarize, expand, translate, or add filler. Each scene's voice_script
     MUST be a contiguous slice of the user's input (with at most light
     whitespace cleanup).
  2. Split the script into AS MANY scenes as the story needs — do NOT force
     a fixed count. Break at natural breath/topic boundaries, usually one
     sentence or one short paragraph per scene. Target 8-18 spoken seconds
     per scene (Vietnamese reads at ~14 chars/sec, English ~15 chars/sec).
     NEVER let a single scene exceed ~3 sentences / ~25 seconds — split a
     long passage into multiple scenes so no scene drones on. A long story
     legitimately yields 20-40 scenes; a short one yields 5-8.
  3. The CONCATENATED voice_script across all scenes, joined with single
     spaces, MUST reproduce the user's input (ignoring punctuation cleanup
     + whitespace normalization).
  4. Detect language from the user's script and set ``language`` field +
     pick voice accordingly. Do NOT translate.
  5. Per scene, emit BOTH ``image_prompt`` (English FLUX prompt 15-30 words,
     describing the visual that matches the narration content) AND
     ``stock_query`` (2-4 English keywords). Both are required regardless
     of media_source — composer chooses which to use at render time.
  6. Title: pull a short title (4-8 words) from the first scene's content,
     or coin one that captures the script's theme. Keep it in the user's
     language.
  7. If media_source = ai_image: still emit the ``characters`` cast +
     ``setting_brief`` so character lock works, and set each scene's
     ``character_names`` to who appears in it. Build the cast from the
     recurring subjects across the script — if it is an animal fable, the
     cast members ARE the animals (describe them as animals, never humans).

WHAT YOU MAY DO:

  - Lightly clean up obvious typos and inconsistent quotes/dashes inside
    voice_script (cosmetic only — never change wording).
  - Choose where to break scenes so each visual makes sense for ~10-20s of
    speech (don't put 3 different visual subjects in one scene).
  - Pick the dominant theme tone if the user-supplied theme conflicts with
    the script's actual mood (mention it once in the TITLE if needed but
    don't change voice_script).

WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO:

  - ❌ Rewrite or paraphrase the user's narration
  - ❌ Add intro/outro sentences not in the user's script
  - ❌ Translate the script into another language
  - ❌ Skip parts of the user's script
  - ❌ Insert filler ("Chào các bạn", "Hôm nay…") unless the user wrote it
