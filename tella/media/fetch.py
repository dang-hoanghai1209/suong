"""Top-level media dispatcher — fetch every scene's asset for a plan.

Given a :class:`TellaScenePlan`, ``fetch_assets`` walks every body scene
and writes one asset file per scene into ``<job_dir>/assets/`` based on
the plan's ``media_source``:

  - ``ai_image``    → CF Workers AI FLUX → JPG
  - ``stock_photo`` → Pexels Photo       → JPG
  - ``stock_video`` → Pexels Video       → MP4

For v1 MVP each scene gets exactly 1 asset. Multi-asset per scene
(``Scene.asset_count`` > 1) is deferred to a later iteration — the field
is preserved on the plan for downstream consumers but the media layer
ignores it for now (see DECISIONS.md D-007).

Scenes are fetched concurrently up to ``MAX_CONCURRENT`` to keep render
turnaround tight. Failures bubble per scene — the dispatcher does NOT
swap providers (e.g. stock photo when stock video fails) because cross-
provider fallback would silently change what the user asked for.
