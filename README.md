# Tella

**Turn a topic into a narrated story video — fully on your own machine.**

Type a topic, answer a few questions, and Tella writes a scene-by-scene
story, narrates it, finds or generates the visuals, and renders a finished
MP4. It runs on a free-tier AI stack (no subscriptions), and every file
stays on your hard drive.

```
You type:        "the lighthouse keeper who learned to rest"
Tella gives you: video.mp4   (1080×1920 or 1920×1080, narrated, ready to post)
```

- **9:16** vertical (TikTok / Reels / Shorts) or **16:9** horizontal (YouTube)
- Visuals from **AI image** (cinematic FLUX art), **stock photo**, or **stock video**
- **Consistent characters** — in AI image mode the same protagonist + setting
  are locked across every scene (no "different face each shot" problem)
- **4 themes**: cinematic · parable · mindfulness · playful
- **Two lengths**: short (~60–120s) or detailed (~4–6 min)
- **8 narration languages**: English, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese,
  German, French, Spanish — give it a topic in any language, pick the output language
- Free narration via Edge TTS (no key needed); optional Google Chirp 3 HD upgrade

## Quick start

### 1. Requirements

| Tool | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.12+ | Runs the pipeline | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check **"Add Python to PATH"** |
| ffmpeg | Audio + video composition, Ken Burns, transitions | Win: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` · Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` · Linux: `apt install ffmpeg` |

### 2. Setup (one-time)

```
Windows:    SETUP.bat
Mac/Linux:  ./SETUP.sh
```

SETUP creates a virtual env under `.venv/` and installs dependencies. Then copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys (see [Keys](#keys) below).

The only **required** key is `GEMINI_API_KEY` (free, generous quota) —
grab one at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> in about 30 seconds.

### 3. Run

```
Windows:    RUN.bat
Mac/Linux:  ./RUN.sh
```

With no arguments you get the guided wizard:

## CLI (for power users / automation)

Pass any flag to skip the wizard:

```bash
python -m tella \
  --topic "the lighthouse keeper who learned to rest" \
  --lang en \
  --aspect 9:16 \
  --media ai_image \
  --duration short \
  --theme cinematic \
  --out ./out
```

| Flag | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--topic` | any text (required) | — |
| `--lang` | `vi en ja ko zh de fr es` (required) | — |
| `--aspect` | `9:16` `16:9` | `9:16` |

| `--theme` | `cinematic` `parable` `playful` `mindfulness` | `cinematic` |
| `--gender` | `male` `female` | theme default |
| `--out` | output dir | `./out` (or `$TELLA_OUTPUT_DIR`) |

## How visuals work

**AI image** (`ai_image`) — the planner first writes a one-shot
**character brief** and **setting brief** (e.g. *"small slender fox with
rust-colored fur, dark blue scarf, Studio Ghibli style"* in *"an ancient
misty forest of glowing mushrooms, blue hour"*). Those briefs are prepended
to every scene's image prompt, so Cloudflare Workers AI (FLUX) renders the
**same character in the same world across all scenes**. This is what keeps a
story visually coherent instead of looking like eight unrelated pictures.

**Stock photo / video** (`stock_photo`, `stock_video`) — pulls real Pexels
media per scene. Character locking isn't possible with random stock, so Tella
keeps coherence with consistent color grading, transitions, and overlay style
instead. Fast, realistic, and free.

## Themes

| Theme | Tone | Imagery |
|---|---|---|
| `cinematic` | Documentary, dramatic-but-restrained | Photorealistic, film grain, teal-orange grade |
| `parable` | Meditative third-person fable | Watercolor, Studio-Ghibli-inspired |
| `mindfulness` | Calm dharma-talk reflection | Recurring monk character, warm watercolor |
| `playful` | Upbeat children's-book read-aloud | Vibrant cartoon, bold colors |

---

## Keys

See `.env.example`. Only `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required; everything else
unlocks an upgrade in its provider chain.

| Key | Unlocks | Free? |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | **Required** — story planning + translation | ✅ Free tier |
| `CF_ACCOUNTS` (or `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`+`CF_AI_TOKEN`) | AI image mode (Cloudflare Workers AI / FLUX) | ✅ 10k images/day/account |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | Stock photo + stock video modes | ✅ 200 req/hr, 20k/mo |
| `GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY` *or* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Studio-quality Chirp 3 HD voices | Pay-as-you-go (tiny) |

Narration falls back to **Edge TTS**, which needs no key at all — so the
minimum to render a complete video is just `GEMINI_API_KEY` + one image
source (`PEXELS_API_KEY` is the easiest).

**Cloudflare multi-account rotation:** `CF_ACCOUNTS` takes a
semicolon-separated list of `account_id:api_token` pairs. Each free account
gives ~2000 FLUX images/day, so a few accounts let you render all day for $0.

## Output

```
out/
└── 20260627_174751_the_lighthouse_keeper/
    ├── video.mp4          ← the finished video
    ├── plan.json          ← scene-by-scene plan (story, prompts, timing)
    ├── assets/            ← per-scene images + narration mp3s
    └── _render/           ← intermediate scene clips (safe to delete)
```

Delete a job's `assets/` and `_render/` once you have the `video.mp4` to
reclaim disk.

## Cost

A typical short with Gemini + Edge TTS + (Cloudflare FLUX **or** Pexels) +
ffmpeg costs **$0**. Adding Google Chirp 3 HD narration bumps it to a few
hundredths of a cent per video.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `python not found` during SETUP | Reinstall Python with "Add Python to PATH" checked |
| `ffmpeg not found` | Win: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` · Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` · Linux: `apt install ffmpeg` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY missing` | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste a free key from aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| AI images look generic / placeholder | Set `CF_ACCOUNTS` (or `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`+`CF_AI_TOKEN`) for Cloudflare FLUX |
| `WSServerHandshakeError 403` from Edge TTS | ISP/region block — set `GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY` to use Google TTS instead |
| Vietnamese diacritics garbled in the terminal | RUN.bat/RUN.sh already set `PYTHONUTF8=1`; run through those wrappers |
